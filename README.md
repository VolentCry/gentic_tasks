# gentic_tasks
This is a small project to solve problems on genetics for the use in biology, but my task is to make it universal, capable of processing large amounts of information, solving complex genetic problems.

So far, to work with the algorithm, open the main file, call the genetic_programme function, enter the first parent, the second parent in the parameters, as a result you will get all possible answers.
